# JSPC Maven Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bliblidotcom/jspc-maven-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bliblidotcom/jspc-maven-plugin)

## Info

A Maven plugin that compiles JSPs into class files, copies these into the final artifact, and updates the web.xml to reference the compiled classes. This is a fork of the [Codehaus jspc-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/jspc/jspc-maven-plugin/) that resolves some long standing issues and gets the Tomcat 7 support released.

## Usage

See the [Maven Project Documentation](http://developer.jasig.org/projects/jspc-maven-plugin/2.0.0/jspc-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html) for goal documentation.

[Plugin Usage](http://developer.jasig.org/projects/jspc-maven-plugin/2.0.0/jspc-maven-plugin/usage.html) is also documented on the maven site.
